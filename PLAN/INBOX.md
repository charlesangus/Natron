A Switch's per-file key/value metadata (custom header attributes) always comes from its input 0, not the input it routes to at that frame, so a Write over a keyed Switch writes the first source's custom attributes into every file. Found while writing M167 P5.T4 (NativeWriteMetadata EachFileOfASequenceTakesItsOwnFramesFormat checks only size and PAR). Fix belongs in Switch / NativeEffectBase::getOutputMetadata routing; outside M167's files.
